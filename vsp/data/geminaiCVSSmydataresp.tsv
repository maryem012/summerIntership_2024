The Eufy Homebase 2 before firmware version 3.3.4.1h creates a dedicated wireless network for its ecosystem, which serves as a proxy to the end user's primary network. The WPA2-PSK generation of this dedicated network is flawed and solely based on the serial number. Due to the flawed generation process, the WPA2-PSK can be brute forced offline within seconds. This vulnerability allows an attacker in proximity to the dedicated wireless network to gain unauthorized access to the end user's primary network.

bpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG

When BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is set, the trampoline calls
__bpf_tramp_enter() and __bpf_tramp_exit() functions, passing them
the struct bpf_tramp_image *im pointer as an argument in R0.

The trampoline generation code uses emit_addr_mov_i64() to emit
instructions for moving the bpf_tramp_image address into R0, but
emit_addr_mov_i64() assumes the address to be in the vmalloc() space
and uses only 48 bits. Because bpf_tramp_image is allocated using
kzalloc(), its address can use more than 48-bits, in this case the
trampoline will pass an invalid address to __bpf_tramp_enter/exit()
causing a kernel crash.

Fix this by using emit_a64_mov_i64() in place of emit_addr_mov_i64()

Though smc_cdc_tx_handler() checked the existence of smc connection,
smc_release() may have already dismissed and released the smc socket
before smc_cdc_tx_handler() further visits it.

To make sure we won't receive any CDC messages after we free the
smc_sock, add a refcount on the smc_connection for inflight CDC
message(posted to the QP but haven't received related CQE), and
don't release the smc_connection until all the inflight CDC messages
haven been done, for both success or failed ones.

Using refcount on CDC messages brings another problem: when the link
is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset the QP, which
then remove all the pending CQEs related to the QP in the CQ. To make
sure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on the
smc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced
by smc_ib_modify_qp_error().
And remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we
need to wait for all pending WQEs done, or we may encounter use-after-
free when handling CQEs.

For IB device removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that
device been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or
the refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be
released."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty

When processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like

 ""profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}""

a string "":samba-dcerpcd"" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then
passed to aa_splitn_fqname().

aa_splitn_fqname() treats "":samba-dcerpcd"" as only containing a namespace.
Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later
aa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name is NULL now.

It seems such behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in
other places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there
is an explicit comment ""a ns name without a following profile is allowed""
inside.

AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked ""name"" to be in form like
"":samba-dcerpcd"" - it is passed from userspace.

Deny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with
EPROTO and an explaining message.
