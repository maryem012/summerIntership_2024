CVE-2024-50067	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.
\#define STRLEN 4093

void generate_string(char *str, int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        char c = i % 26 + 'a';
        str[i] = c;
    }
    str[n-1] = '\0';
}

void print_string(char *str)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", str);
}

int main()
{
    char tmp[STRLEN];

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

    return 0;
}
```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

CVE-2024-47883	"The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works: ""opening a connection"" to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file:/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths; the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the app's codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the server's filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (server-side request forgery with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victim's browser (cross-site scripting). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (remote code execution). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch."	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
CVE-2024-47882	"OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the built-in ""Something went wrong!"" error page includes the exception message and exception traceback without escaping HTML tags, enabling injection into the page if an attacker can reliably produce an error with an attacker-influenced message. It appears that the only way to reach this code in OpenRefine itself is for an attacker to somehow convince a victim to import a malicious file, which may be difficult.  However, out-of-tree extensions may add their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`. Version 3.8.3 has a fix for this issue."	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-47880	OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also taken from the request. An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those extensions are also present. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-50058	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too

Commit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part
3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown(), so
the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that
protection, there is an unprotected ""uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);""
call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the
reason why we do not see lots of these reports.

Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.

Until the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this
dereference to the if too.

CVE-2024-31842	An issue was discovered in Italtel Embrace 1.6.4. The web application inserts the access token of an authenticated user inside GET requests. The query string for the URL could be saved in the browser's history, passed through Referers to other web sites, stored in web logs, or otherwise recorded in other sources. If the query string contains sensitive information such as session identifiers, then attackers can use this information to launch further attacks. Because the access token in sent in GET requests, this vulnerability could lead to complete account takeover.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2024-43843	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv, bpf: Fix out-of-bounds issue when preparing trampoline image

We get the size of the trampoline image during the dry run phase and
allocate memory based on that size. The allocated image will then be
populated with instructions during the real patch phase. But after
commit 26ef208c209a (""bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size""), the `im`
argument is inconsistent in the dry run and real patch phase. This may
cause emit_imm in RV64 to generate a different number of instructions
when generating the 'im' address, potentially causing out-of-bounds
issues. Let's emit the maximum number of instructions for the ""im""
address during dry run to fix this problem."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2024-43841	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: virt_wifi: avoid reporting connection success with wrong SSID

When user issues a connection with a different SSID than the one
virt_wifi has advertised, the __cfg80211_connect_result() will
trigger the warning: WARN_ON(bss_not_found).

The issue is because the connection code in virt_wifi does not
check the SSID from user space (it only checks the BSSID), and
virt_wifi will call cfg80211_connect_result() with WLAN_STATUS_SUCCESS
even if the SSID is different from the one virt_wifi has advertised.
Eventually cfg80211 won't be able to find the cfg80211_bss and generate
the warning.

CVE-2024-43840	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG

When BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is set, the trampoline calls
__bpf_tramp_enter() and __bpf_tramp_exit() functions, passing them
the struct bpf_tramp_image *im pointer as an argument in R0.

The trampoline generation code uses emit_addr_mov_i64() to emit
instructions for moving the bpf_tramp_image address into R0, but
emit_addr_mov_i64() assumes the address to be in the vmalloc() space
and uses only 48 bits. Because bpf_tramp_image is allocated using
kzalloc(), its address can use more than 48-bits, in this case the
trampoline will pass an invalid address to __bpf_tramp_enter/exit()
causing a kernel crash.

Fix this by using emit_a64_mov_i64() in place of emit_addr_mov_i64()
as it can work with addresses that are greater than 48-bits."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-43834	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xdp: fix invalid wait context of page_pool_destroy()

If the driver uses a page pool, it creates a page pool with
page_pool_create().
The reference count of page pool is 1 as default.
A page pool will be destroyed only when a reference count reaches 0.
page_pool_destroy() is used to destroy page pool, it decreases a
reference count.
When a page pool is destroyed, ->disconnect() is called, which is
mem_allocator_disconnect().
This function internally acquires mutex_lock().

If the driver uses XDP, it registers a memory model with
xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model().
The xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model() internally increases a page pool
reference count if a memory model is a page pool.
Now the reference count is 2.

To destroy a page pool, the driver should call both page_pool_destroy()
and xdp_unreg_mem_model().
The xdp_unreg_mem_model() internally calls page_pool_destroy().
Only page_pool_destroy() decreases a reference count.

If a driver calls page_pool_destroy() then xdp_unreg_mem_model(), we
will face an invalid wait context warning.
Because xdp_unreg_mem_model() calls page_pool_destroy() with
rcu_read_lock().
The page_pool_destroy() internally acquires mutex_lock().

To fix this problem, it uses rhashtable_lookup_fast() instead of
rhashtable_lookup() with rcu_read_lock().
Using xa without rcu_read_lock() here is safe.
xa is freed by __xdp_mem_allocator_rcu_free() and this is called by
call_rcu() of mem_xa_remove().
The mem_xa_remove() is called by page_pool_destroy() if a reference
count reaches 0.
The xa is already protected by the reference count mechanism well in the
control plane.
So removing rcu_read_lock() for page_pool_destroy() is safe."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

i2c: virtio: fix completion handling

The driver currently assumes that the notify callback is only received
when the device is done with all the queued buffers.

However, this is not true, since the notify callback could be called
without any of the queued buffers being completed (for example, with
virtio-pci and shared interrupts) or with only some of the buffers being
completed (since the driver makes them available to the device in
multiple separate virtqueue_add_sgs() calls).

This can lead to incorrect data on the I2C bus or memory corruption in
the guest if the device operates on buffers which are have been freed by
the driver.  (The WARN_ON in the driver is also triggered.)

bpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic fetch

The change in commit 37086bfdc737 (""bpf: Propagate stack bounds to registers
in atomics w/ BPF_FETCH"") around check_mem_access() handling is buggy since
this would allow for unprivileged users to leak kernel pointers. For example,
an atomic fetch/and with -1 on a stack destination which holds a spilled
pointer will migrate the spilled register type into a scalar, which can then
be exported out of the program (since scalar != pointer) by dumping it into
a map value.

The original implementation of XADD was preventing this situation by using
a double call to check_mem_access() one with BPF_READ and a subsequent one
with BPF_WRITE, in both cases passing -1 as a placeholder value instead of
register as per XADD semantics since it didn't contain a value fetch. The
BPF_READ also included a check in check_stack_read_fixed_off() which rejects
the program if the stack slot is of __is_pointer_value() if dst_regno < 0.
The latter is to distinguish whether we're dealing with a regular stack spill/
fill or some arithmetical operation which is disallowed on non-scalars, see
also 6e7e63cbb023 (""bpf: Forbid XADD on spilled pointers for unprivileged
users"") for more context on check_mem_access() and its handling of placeholder
value -1.

One minimally intrusive option to fix the leak is for the BPF_FETCH case to
initially check the BPF_READ case via check_mem_access() with -1 as register,
followed by the actual load case with non-negative load_reg to propagate
stack bounds to registers."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
CVE-2021-47607	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic cmpxchg's r0 aux reg

The implementation of BPF_CMPXCHG on a high level has the following parameters:

  .-[old-val]                                          .-[new-val]
  BPF_R0 = cmpxchg{32,64}(DST_REG + insn->off, BPF_R0, SRC_REG)
                          `-[mem-loc]          `-[old-val]

Given a BPF insn can only have two registers (dst, src), the R0 is fixed and
used as an auxilliary register for input (old value) as well as output (returning
old value from memory location). While the verifier performs a number of safety
checks, it misses to reject unprivileged programs where R0 contains a pointer as
old value.

Through brute-forcing it takes about ~16sec on my machine to leak a kernel pointer
with BPF_CMPXCHG. The PoC is basically probing for kernel addresses by storing the
guessed address into the map slot as a scalar, and using the map value pointer as
R0 while SRC_REG has a canary value to detect a matching address.

Fix it by checking R0 for pointers, and reject if that's the case for unprivileged
programs."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2021-47603	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

audit: improve robustness of the audit queue handling

If the audit daemon were ever to get stuck in a stopped state the
kernel's kauditd_thread() could get blocked attempting to send audit
records to the userspace audit daemon.  With the kernel thread
blocked it is possible that the audit queue could grow unbounded as
certain audit record generating events must be exempt from the queue
limits else the system enter a deadlock state.

This patch resolves this problem by lowering the kernel thread's
socket sending timeout from MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT to HZ/10 and tweaks
the kauditd_send_queue() function to better manage the various audit
queues when connection problems occur between the kernel and the
audit daemon.  With this patch, the backlog may temporarily grow
beyond the defined limits when the audit daemon is stopped and the
system is under heavy audit pressure, but kauditd_thread() will
continue to make progress and drain the queues as it would for other
connection problems.  For example, with the audit daemon put into a
stopped state and the system configured to audit every syscall it
was still possible to shutdown the system without a kernel panic,
deadlock, etc.; granted, the system was slow to shutdown but that is
to be expected given the extreme pressure of recording every syscall.

The timeout value of HZ/10 was chosen primarily through
experimentation and this developer's ""gut feeling"".  There is likely
no one perfect value, but as this scenario is limited in scope (root
privileges would be needed to send SIGSTOP to the audit daemon), it
is likely not worth exposing this as a tunable at present.  This can
always be done at a later date if it proves necessary."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

latest_dev is updated according to the changes to the device list.

mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets

The mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being set correctly:
It prevents setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_ULP, ""mptcp"", 6); from
working for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).

But in case of fallback, accept() can return a plain tcp sk.
In such case, sk is still tagged as 'kernel' and setsockopt will work.

This will crash the kernel, The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn

The above issue is due to previous incorrect implementation of
tc_del_vlan_flow(), shown below, that uses flow_cls_offload_flow_rule()
to get struct flow_rule *rule which is no longer valid for tc filter
delete operation.

  struct flow_rule *rule = flow_cls_offload_flow_rule(cls);
  struct flow_dissector *dissector = rule->match.dissector;

So, to ensure tc_del_vlan_flow() deletes the right VLAN cls record for
earlier configured RX queue (configured by hw_tc) in tc_add_vlan_flow(),
this patch introduces stmmac_rfs_entry as driver-side flow_cls_offload
record for 'RX frame steering' tc flower, currently used for VLAN
priority. The implementation has taken consideration for future extension
to include other type RX frame steering such as EtherType based.

CVE-2021-47587	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: systemport: Add global locking for descriptor lifecycle

The descriptor list is a shared resource across all of the transmit queues, and
the locking mechanism used today only protects concurrency across a given
transmit queue between the transmit and reclaiming. This creates an opportunity
for the SYSTEMPORT hardware to work on corrupted descriptors if we have
multiple producers at once which is the case when using multiple transmit
queues.

This was particularly noticeable when using multiple flows/transmit queues and
it showed up in interesting ways in that UDP packets would get a correct UDP
header checksum being calculated over an incorrect packet length. Similarly TCP
packets would get an equally correct checksum computed by the hardware over an
incorrect packet length.

The SYSTEMPORT hardware maintains an internal descriptor list that it re-arranges
when the driver produces a new descriptor anytime it writes to the
WRITE_PORT_{HI,LO} registers, there is however some delay in the hardware to
re-organize its descriptors and it is possible that concurrent TX queues
eventually break this internal allocation scheme to the point where the
length/status part of the descriptor gets used for an incorrect data buffer.

The fix is to impose a global serialization for all TX queues in the short
section where we are writing to the WRITE_PORT_{HI,LO} registers which solves
the corruption even with multiple concurrent TX queues being used."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

is being searched in ftrace pages of some module, but those ftrace pages
at the same time is being freed in ftrace_release_mod() as the
corresponding module is being deleted:

          lookup_rec() // USE!        |   ftrace_release_mod() // Free!

To fix this issue:
  1. Hold rcu lock as accessing ftrace pages in ftrace_location_range();
  2. Use ftrace_location_range() instead of lookup_rec() in
     ftrace_location();
  3. Call synchronize_rcu() before freeing any ftrace pages both in

This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2024-5124	A timing attack vulnerability exists in the gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt repository, specifically within the password comparison logic. The vulnerability is present in version 20240310 of the software, where passwords are compared using the '=' operator in Python. This method of comparison allows an attacker to guess passwords based on the timing of each character's comparison. The issue arises from the code segment that checks a password for a particular username, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially guess user passwords, compromising the security of the system.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
CVE-2024-4888	BerriAI's litellm, in its latest version, is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to improper input validation on the `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request that includes a file path to the server, which then deletes the specified file without proper authorization or validation. This vulnerability is present in the code where `os.remove(file.filename)` is used to delete a file, allowing any user to delete critical files on the server such as SSH keys, SQLite databases, or configuration files.

CVE-2024-3408	man-group/dtale version 3.10.0 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass and remote code execution (RCE) due to improper input validation. The vulnerability arises from a hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` in the flask configuration, allowing attackers to forge a session cookie if authentication is enabled. Additionally, the application fails to properly restrict custom filter queries, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by bypassing the restriction on the `/update-settings` endpoint, even when `enable_custom_filters` is not enabled. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and execute remote code on the server.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2024-3150	In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists in the thread update process that allows users with Default or Manager roles to escalate their privileges to Administrator. The issue arises from improper input validation when handling HTTP POST requests to the endpoint `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`. Specifically, the application fails to validate or check user input before passing it to the `workspace_thread` Prisma model for execution. This oversight allows attackers to craft a Prisma relation query operation that manipulates the `users` model to change a user's role to admin. Successful exploitation grants attackers the highest level of user privileges, enabling them to see and perform all actions within the system.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2024-3102	A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application, specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
CVE-2024-2965	A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader` class of the `langchain-ai/langchain` repository, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent infinite recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.

CVE-2024-5127	In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
CVE-2024-3152	mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2024-3033	An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H

CVE-2022-48689	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status

We got a recent syzbot report [1] showing a possible misuse
of pfmemalloc page status in TCP zerocopy paths.

Indeed, for pages coming from user space or other layers,
using page_is_pfmemalloc() is moot, and possibly could give
false positives.

There has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,
but not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,
removing cpu cycles.

Note to stable teams :

You need to backport 84ce071e38a6 (""net: introduce
__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc"") as a prereq.

Race is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4
(""mm: add a signature in struct page"") because page_is_pfmemalloc()
is now using low order bit from page->lru.next, which can change

Low order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchor
in LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.

Backporting to older kernel versions seems not necessary.

Bluetooth: rfcomm: Fix null-ptr-deref in rfcomm_check_security

During our fuzz testing of the connection and disconnection process at the
RFCOMM layer, we discovered this bug. By comparing the packets from a
normal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that
triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:

1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a
`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet
(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of
encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately
replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the
Encryption Key Size.

2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this
packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP
layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.

3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described
in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.
However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`
had already been released, and when the function executed
`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,
specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.

To fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling
rfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches

The hashtab code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of
hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the
resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself
can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,
which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate
neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which
contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. So apply the same
fix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check to before the roundup."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

message(posted to the QP but haven't received related CQE), and
don't release the smc_connection until all the inflight CDC messages
haven been done, for both success or failed ones.

Using refcount on CDC messages brings another problem: when the link
is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset the QP, which
then remove all the pending CQEs related to the QP in the CQ. To make
sure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on the
smc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced
by smc_ib_modify_qp_error().
And remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we
need to wait for all pending WQEs done, or we may encounter use-after-
free when handling CQEs.

For IB device removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that
device been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or
the refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be

bpf: fix check for attempt to corrupt spilled pointer

When register is spilled onto a stack as a 1/2/4-byte register, we set
slot_type[BPF_REG_SIZE - 1] (plus potentially few more below it,
depending on actual spill size). So to check if some stack slot has
spilled register we need to consult slot_type[7], not slot_type[0].

To avoid the need to remember and double-check this in the future, just
use is_spilled_reg() helper."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size

Before calling add partition or resize partition, there is no check
on whether the length is aligned with the logical block size.
If the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes,
then the partition size maybe not the multiple of the logical block size,
and when the last sector is read, bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size,
resulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller than
the logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will also
result in a null pointer dereference when calling bio_integrity_free."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

are leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port() has the

serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock

When using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to
control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the
TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during
userland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface
and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,
imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered
by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx
statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in
deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.

imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC
interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure
the state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to

                                gluebi->desc - NULL

Detailed reproduction information available at the Link [1],

In the normal case, obtain gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(),
and access gluebi->desc in the gluebi_read(). However,
gluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in the
ftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.

The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBI

CVE-2023-52447	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary

When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map
may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program.
However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map
directly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one
(which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by
ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks
don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a
RCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes,
the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur
use-after-free problem.

Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both
one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner
map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is
accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when
releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head
field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to
reduce the size of bpf_map."	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty

When processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like

 ""profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}""

a string "":samba-dcerpcd"" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then
passed to aa_splitn_fqname().

aa_splitn_fqname() treats "":samba-dcerpcd"" as only containing a namespace.
Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later
aa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name is NULL now.

It seems such behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in
other places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there
is an explicit comment ""a ns name without a following profile is allowed""
inside.

AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked ""name"" to be in form like
"":samba-dcerpcd"" - it is passed from userspace.

Deny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with
EPROTO and an explaining message.

binder: fix use-after-free in shinker's callback

The mmap read lock is used during the shrinker's callback, which means
that using alloc->vma pointer isn't safe as it can race with munmap().
As of commit dd2283f2605e (""mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"") the mmap lock is downgraded after the vma has been isolated.

I was able to reproduce this issue by manually adding some delays and
triggering page reclaiming through the shrinker's debug sysfs. The

CVE-2022-31621	MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVE-2022-25514	stb_truetype.h v1.26 was discovered to contain a heap-buffer-overflow via the function ttUSHORT() at stb_truetype.h.

CVE-2022-24329	In JetBrains Kotlin before 1.6.0, it was not possible to lock dependencies for Multiplatform Gradle Projects.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
CVE-2021-45956	"Dnsmasq 2.86 has a heap-based buffer overflow in print_mac (called from log_packet and dhcp_reply). NOTE: the vendor's position is that CVE-2021-45951 through CVE-2021-45957 ""do not represent real vulnerabilities, to the best of our knowledge."	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2021-45046	It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2021-42694	An issue was discovered in the character definitions of the Unicode Specification through 14.0. The specification allows an adversary to produce source code identifiers such as function names using homoglyphs that render visually identical to a target identifier. Adversaries can leverage this to inject code via adversarial identifier definitions in upstream software dependencies invoked deceptively in downstream software. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard (all versions). Unless mitigated, an adversary could produce source code identifiers using homoglyph characters that render visually identical to but are distinct from a target identifier. In this way, an adversary could inject adversarial identifier definitions in upstream software that are not detected by human reviewers and are invoked deceptively in downstream software. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of security vulnerability in its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2021-40812	The GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) through 2.3.2 has an out-of-bounds read because of the lack of certain gdGetBuf and gdPutBuf return value checks.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVE-2021-29544	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`. This is because the implementation does not validate the rank of the `input_*` tensors. In turn, this results in the tensors being passes as they are to `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl`. However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure otherwise. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 as this is the only other affected version.	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVE-2020-14318	A flaw was found in the way samba handled file and directory permissions. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain access to certain file and directory information which otherwise would be unavailable to the attacker.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
