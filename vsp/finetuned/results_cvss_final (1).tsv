CVE Description	CVSS_Vector
The Anchor Episodes Index (Spotify for Podcasters) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's anchor_episodes shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array

dlpar_memory_remove_by_index() may access beyond the bounds of the
drmem lmb array when the LMB lookup fails to match an entry with the
given DRC index. When the search fails, the cursor is left pointing to
&drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs], which is one element past the
last valid entry in the array. The debug message at the end of the
function then dereferences this pointer:

        pr_debug(""Failed to hot-remove memory at %llx\n"",
                 lmb->base_addr);

This was found by inspection and confirmed with KASAN:

The Eufy Homebase 2 before firmware version 3.3.4.1h creates a dedicated wireless network for its ecosystem, which serves as a proxy to the end user's primary network. The WPA2-PSK generation of this dedicated network is flawed and solely based on the serial number. Due to the flawed generation process, the WPA2-PSK can be brute forced offline within seconds. This vulnerability allows an attacker in proximity to the dedicated wireless network to gain unauthorized access to the end user's primary network. The only requirement of the attack is proximity to the dedicated wireless network.	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The `add_llm` function in `llm_app.py` in infiniflow/ragflow version 0.11.0 contains a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. The function uses user-supplied input `req['llm_factory']` and `req['llm_name']` to dynamically instantiate classes from various model dictionaries. This approach allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code due to the lack of comprehensive input validation or sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious value for 'llm_factory' that, when used as an index to these model dictionaries, results in the execution of arbitrary code.

commit 26ef208c209a (""bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size""), the `im`

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG

When BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is set, the trampoline calls
__bpf_tramp_enter() and __bpf_tramp_exit() functions, passing them
the struct bpf_tramp_image *im pointer as an argument in R0.

The trampoline generation code uses emit_addr_mov_i64() to emit
instructions for moving the bpf_tramp_image address into R0, but
emit_addr_mov_i64() assumes the address to be in the vmalloc() space
and uses only 48 bits. Because bpf_tramp_image is allocated using
kzalloc(), its address can use more than 48-bits, in this case the
trampoline will pass an invalid address to __bpf_tramp_enter/exit()
causing a kernel crash.

Fix this by using emit_a64_mov_i64() in place of emit_addr_mov_i64()
as it can work with addresses that are greater than 48-bits."	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: never allow the PM to close a listener subflow

Currently, when deleting an endpoint the netlink PM treverses
all the local MPTCP sockets, regardless of their status.

If an MPTCP listener socket is bound to the IP matching the
delete endpoint, the listener TCP socket will be closed.
That is unexpected, the PM should only affect data subflows.

Vulnerability in Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).  Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u421, 8u421-perf, 11.0.24, 17.0.12, 21.0.4 and  23. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE.  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. This vulnerability also applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security.

To make sure we won't receive any CDC messages after we free the

message(posted to the QP but haven't received related CQE), and
don't release the smc_connection until all the inflight CDC messages
haven been done, for both success or failed ones.

Using refcount on CDC messages brings another problem: when the link
is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset the QP, which
then remove all the pending CQEs related to the QP in the CQ. To make
sure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on the
smc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced
by smc_ib_modify_qp_error().
And remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we
need to wait for all pending WQEs done, or we may encounter use-after-
free when handling CQEs.

For IB device removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that
device been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or
the refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be

apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty

When processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like

 ""profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}""

a string "":samba-dcerpcd"" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then
passed to aa_splitn_fqname().

aa_splitn_fqname() treats "":samba-dcerpcd"" as only containing a namespace.
Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later
aa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name is NULL now.

other places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there
is an explicit comment ""a ns name without a following profile is allowed""

Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data.

net: stmmac: fix tc flower deletion for VLAN priority Rx steering

To replicate the issue:-

1) Add 1 flower filter for VLAN Priority based frame steering:-
$ IFDEVNAME=eth0
$ tc qdisc add dev $IFDEVNAME ingress
$ tc qdisc add dev $IFDEVNAME root mqprio num_tc 8 \
   map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \
   queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 hw 0
$ tc filter add dev $IFDEVNAME parent ffff: protocol 802.1Q \
   flower vlan_prio 0 hw_tc 0

2) Get the 'pref' id
$ tc filter show dev $IFDEVNAME ingress

3) Delete a specific tc flower record (say pref 49151)
$ tc filter del dev $IFDEVNAME parent ffff: pref 49151

The above issue is due to previous incorrect implementation of
tc_del_vlan_flow(), shown below, that uses flow_cls_offload_flow_rule()
to get struct flow_rule *rule which is no longer valid for tc filter
delete operation.

  struct flow_rule *rule = flow_cls_offload_flow_rule(cls);
  struct flow_dissector *dissector = rule->match.dissector;

So, to ensure tc_del_vlan_flow() deletes the right VLAN cls record for
earlier configured RX queue (configured by hw_tc) in tc_add_vlan_flow(),
this patch introduces stmmac_rfs_entry as driver-side flow_cls_offload
record for 'RX frame steering' tc flower, currently used for VLAN
priority. The implementation has taken consideration for future extension
to include other type RX frame steering such as EtherType based.
