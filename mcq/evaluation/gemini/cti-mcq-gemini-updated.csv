Which of the following mitigations involves preventing applications from running that haven't been downloaded from legitimate repositories?,Audit,Execution Prevention,Operating System Configuration,User Account Control,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: B) EXECUTION PREVENTION.

EXECUTION PREVENTION IS A SECURITY FEATURE THAT PREVENTS APPLICATIONS FROM RUNNING THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DOWNLOADED FROM LEGITIMATE REPOSITORIES. THIS CAN BE DONE BY CHECKING THE DIGITAL SIGNATURES OF APPLICATIONS OR BY USING A WHITELIST OF APPROVED APPLICATIONS.

AUDIT IS A PROCESS OF REVIEWING AND RECORDING SYSTEM ACTIVITY TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS. OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION IS THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO MEET THE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION. USER ACCOUNT CONTROL IS A SECURITY FEATURE THAT HELPS TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED USERS FROM MAKING CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM.

THEREFORE, THE BEST OPTION IS B) EXECUTION PREVENTION."
Which data source is recommended for monitoring commands that may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevation of privileges?,Command,File,Process,User Account,A,D,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **A) COMMAND**

COMMANDS ARE THE MOST DIRECT WAY TO ELEVATE PRIVILEGES. BY MONITORING COMMANDS, YOU CAN IDENTIFY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY THAT MAY BE AN ATTEMPT TO ELEVATE PRIVILEGES.

FILES, PROCESSES, AND USER ACCOUNTS CAN ALSO BE USED TO ELEVATE PRIVILEGES, BUT THEY ARE LESS DIRECT THAN COMMANDS. FOR EXAMPLE, AN ATTACKER COULD CREATE A MALICIOUS FILE THAT, WHEN EXECUTED, WOULD ELEVATE PRIVILEGES. HOWEVER, THIS WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT THAN AN ATTACKER SIMPLY RUNNING A COMMAND THAT ELEVATES PRIVILEGES.

THEREFORE, THE BEST DATA SOURCE FOR MONITORING COMMANDS THAT MAY CIRCUMVENT MECHANISMS DESIGNED TO CONTROL ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGES IS **A) COMMAND**."
What does mitigation ID M1028 suggest to prevent privilege escalation exploits on a system?,Limiting privileges of cloud accounts,Preventing unsigned applications from running,Minimizing applications with setuid or setgid bits set,Enforcing the highest UAC level,D,C,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **D)** ENFORCING THE HIGHEST UAC LEVEL.

MITIGATION ID M1028 SUGGESTS TO PREVENT PRIVILEGE ESCALATION EXPLOITS ON A SYSTEM BY ENFORCING THE HIGHEST UAC LEVEL. THIS WILL HELP TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED USERS FROM GAINING ELEVATED PRIVILEGES ON THE SYSTEM.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING PRIVILEGE ESCALATION EXPLOITS. OPTION A, LIMITING PRIVILEGES OF CLOUD ACCOUNTS, MAY HELP TO PREVENT SOME PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ATTACKS, BUT IT IS NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION. OPTION B, PREVENTING UNSIGNED APPLICATIONS FROM RUNNING, MAY HELP TO PREVENT SOME PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ATTACKS, BUT IT IS NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION. OPTION C, MINIMIZING APPLICATIONS WITH SETUID OR SETGID BITS SET, MAY HELP TO PREVENT SOME PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ATTACKS, BUT IT IS NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION.

THEREFORE, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **D)** ENFORCING THE HIGHEST UAC LEVEL."
Which process creation is an indicator of potential SYSTEM privilege escalation according to the detection section?,C:\Windows\System32\services.exe,C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe,C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe,C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe,C,B,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: C.

THE DETECTION SECTION OF THE CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE (CTI) KNOWLEDGE BENCHMARK DATASET STATES THAT THE PROCESS CREATION OF C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\RUNDLL32.EXE IS AN INDICATOR OF POTENTIAL SYSTEM PRIVILEGE ESCALATION.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL SYSTEM PRIVILEGE ESCALATION.

C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\SERVICES.EXE IS A SYSTEM PROCESS THAT RUNS SERVICES.

C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CMD.EXE IS A COMMAND-LINE INTERPRETER THAT CAN BE USED TO RUN COMMANDS.

C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\NOTEPAD.EXE IS A TEXT EDITOR."
"In a Linux environment, what is recommended to monitor for detecting privilege escalation via sudo?",Monitor Windows Registry Key Modification,Monitor OS API Execution,Monitor file metadata for setuid or setgid bits on files,Audit process metadata changes,D,C,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **D**.

TO DETECT PRIVILEGE ESCALATION VIA SUDO, YOU SHOULD AUDIT PROCESS METADATA CHANGES. THIS INCLUDES MONITORING FOR CHANGES TO THE FOLLOWING:

* THE PROCESS OWNER
* THE PROCESS GROUP
* THE PROCESS PERMISSIONS
* THE PROCESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
* THE PROCESS COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

BY MONITORING THESE CHANGES, YOU CAN IDENTIFY ANY ATTEMPTS TO ESCALATE PRIVILEGES.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PRIVILEGE ESCALATION VIA SUDO.

* OPTION A IS INCORRECT BECAUSE IT REFERS TO MONITORING WINDOWS REGISTRY KEY MODIFICATION. THIS IS NOT RELEVANT TO A LINUX ENVIRONMENT.
* OPTION B IS INCORRECT BECAUSE IT REFERS TO MONITORING OS API EXECUTION. THIS IS A GENERAL SECURITY MEASURE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING PRIVILEGE ESCALATION VIA SUDO.
* OPTION C IS INCORRECT BECAUSE IT REFERS TO MONITORING FILE METADATA FOR SETUID OR SETGID BITS ON FILES. THIS IS A SECURITY MEASURE THAT CAN HELP TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO FILES, BUT IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PRIVILEGE ESCALATION VIA SUDO."
What mitigation ID suggests requiring a password every time sudo is executed to manage privileged accounts?,Audit,Privileged Account Management,Restrict File and Directory Permissions,User Account Management,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B) PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT**

PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT (PAM) IS A SECURITY PRACTICE THAT HELPS ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE AND PROTECT THEIR PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS. PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS ARE ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE ELEVATED PERMISSIONS, SUCH AS ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNTS. THESE ACCOUNTS CAN BE USED TO ACCESS SENSITIVE DATA AND SYSTEMS, SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO MANAGE THEM CAREFULLY.

ONE WAY TO MANAGE PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS IS TO REQUIRE A PASSWORD EVERY TIME SUDO IS EXECUTED. THIS WILL HELP TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED USERS FROM ACCESSING SENSITIVE DATA OR SYSTEMS.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS RELEVANT TO THE QUESTION. AUDITING IS THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING SYSTEM LOGS TO IDENTIFY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. RESTRICTING FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS IS THE PROCESS OF LIMITING THE ACCESS THAT USERS HAVE TO FILES AND DIRECTORIES. USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT IS THE PROCESS OF CREATING, MANAGING, AND DEACTIVATING USER ACCOUNTS."
"An adversary leveraging the technique ""Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid"" is targeting which systems from the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise matrix?",Linux,Windows,macOS,Linux and macOS,D,D,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **D) LINUX AND MACOS**

THE ""ABUSE ELEVATION CONTROL MECHANISM: SETUID AND SETGID"" TECHNIQUE IS A TYPE OF PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ATTACK THAT CAN BE USED ON BOTH LINUX AND MACOS SYSTEMS. IT WORKS BY EXPLOITING THE FACT THAT THESE SYSTEMS ALLOW CERTAIN PROGRAMS TO RUN WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES, EVEN IF THEY ARE EXECUTED BY A USER WITH LOW PRIVILEGES. BY ABUSING THIS MECHANISM, AN ATTACKER CAN GAIN ACCESS TO FILES AND RESOURCES THAT THEY WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT INCLUDE ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS ATTACK. OPTION A ONLY INCLUDES LINUX, OPTION B ONLY INCLUDES WINDOWS, AND OPTION C ONLY INCLUDES MACOS."
Which of the following commands would an adversary use to find files with the setgid bit set on a UNIX-based system?,find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null,find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null,ls -l | grep 's',"grep -R ""setgid"" /",A,A,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: A.

THE SETGID BIT IS A PERMISSION BIT THAT ALLOWS A FILE TO BE OWNED BY A GROUP, RATHER THAN BY AN INDIVIDUAL USER. WHEN A FILE HAS THE SETGID BIT SET, ANY PROCESS THAT EXECUTES THE FILE WILL BE RUN AS THE OWNER OF THE FILE'S GROUP, RATHER THAN AS THE USER WHO EXECUTED THE FILE. THIS CAN BE USEFUL FOR PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO ACCESS FILES THAT ARE OWNED BY A GROUP, SUCH AS LOG FILES OR CONFIGURATION FILES.

THE FIND COMMAND IS A POWERFUL TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO SEARCH FOR FILES ON A UNIX-BASED SYSTEM. THE -PERM OPTION CAN BE USED TO SPECIFY A PERMISSION MASK, WHICH IS A SET OF BITS THAT INDICATE WHICH PERMISSIONS SHOULD BE CHECKED. THE +4000 PERMISSION BIT INDICATES THAT THE FILE HAS THE SETGID BIT SET.

THE 2>/DEV/NULL OPTION REDIRECTS THE STANDARD ERROR OUTPUT OF THE FIND COMMAND TO THE NULL DEVICE, WHICH DISCARDS ANY ERROR MESSAGES. THIS IS USEFUL WHEN YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE ERROR MESSAGES THAT ARE GENERATED BY THE FIND COMMAND.

THEREFORE, THE COMMAND FIND / -PERM +4000 2>/DEV/NULL WILL FIND ALL FILES ON THE SYSTEM THAT HAVE THE SETGID BIT SET."
Which mitigation strategy from the MITRE ATT&CK framework is recommended to counteract the abuse of setuid and setgid bits?,M1028 - Ensure disk encryption,M1028 - Operating System Configuration,M1030 - Network Segmentation,M1040 - Application Isolation and Sandboxing,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B) OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION**

THE MITRE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK IS A KNOWLEDGE BASE OF ADVERSARY TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES USED IN REAL-WORLD CYBER ATTACKS. THE FRAMEWORK IS ORGANIZED INTO A TAXONOMY OF 12 TACTICS, EACH OF WHICH IS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO SUB-TECHNIQUES.

THE M1028 TECHNIQUE IS PART OF THE PERSISTENCE TACTIC. THIS TECHNIQUE DESCRIBES HOW AN ADVERSARY CAN ABUSE THE SETUID AND SETGID BITS TO GAIN ELEVATED PRIVILEGES ON A SYSTEM. THE SETUID AND SETGID BITS ARE USED TO INDICATE THAT A PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXECUTED WITH THE PRIVILEGES OF THE USER OR GROUP THAT OWNS THE PROGRAM, RESPECTIVELY. AN ADVERSARY CAN EXPLOIT THIS BY CREATING A PROGRAM THAT HAS THE SETUID OR SETGID BIT SET AND THEN EXECUTING IT. THIS WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO BE EXECUTED WITH THE PRIVILEGES OF THE USER OR GROUP THAT OWNS THE PROGRAM, WHICH COULD ALLOW THE ADVERSARY TO GAIN ELEVATED PRIVILEGES ON THE SYSTEM.

TO MITIGATE THIS RISK, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONFIGURE THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO PREVENT PROGRAMS FROM BEING EXECUTED WITH THE SETUID OR SETGID BIT SET. THIS CAN BE DONE BY SETTING THE APPROPRIATE PERMISSIONS ON THE FILES THAT CONTAIN THE PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE OPERATING SYSTEM UP TO DATE WITH THE LATEST SECURITY PATCHES. THESE PATCHES OFTEN INCLUDE FIXES FOR VULNERABILITIES THAT COULD BE EXPLOITED BY AN ADVERSARY TO ABUSE THE SETUID AND SETGID BITS.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AT MITIGATING THE RISK OF ABUSE OF SETUID AND SETGID BITS. OPTION A, M1028 - ENSURE DISK ENCRYPTION, WOULD PREVENT AN ADVERSARY FROM ACCESSING THE DATA ON THE DISK, BUT IT WOULD NOT PREVENT THE ADVERSARY FROM EXECUTING PROGRAMS WITH THE SETUID OR SETGID BIT SET. OPTION C, M1030 - NETWORK SEGMENTATION, WOULD PREVENT AN ADVERSARY FROM ACCESSING CERTAIN PARTS OF THE NETWORK, BUT IT WOULD NOT PREVENT THE ADVERSARY FROM EXECUTING PROGRAMS WITH THE SETUID OR SETGID BIT SET ON THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE ADVERSARY. OPTION D, M1040 - APPLICATION ISOLATION AND SANDBOXING, WOULD PREVENT AN ADVERSARY FROM ACCESSING SENSITIVE DATA, BUT IT WOULD NOT PREVENT THE ADVERSARY FROM EXECUTING PROGRAMS WITH THE SETUID OR SETGID BIT SET."
Which data source should you monitor to detect changes indicating abuse of setuid or setgid bits on files?,DS0022 - Registry,DS0017 - Command execution,DS0035 - Network Traffic,DS0022 - File Metadata and Modification,D,D,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **D) DS0022 - FILE METADATA AND MODIFICATION**

THE SETUID AND SETGID BITS ARE USED TO SET THE USER AND GROUP IDS OF A FILE TO THE USER OR GROUP THAT OWNS THE FILE, RESPECTIVELY. THIS CAN BE USED TO ALLOW A PROGRAM TO RUN WITH THE PRIVILEGES OF THE OWNER OF THE FILE, EVEN IF THE PROGRAM IS EXECUTED BY A DIFFERENT USER. THIS CAN BE A SECURITY RISK, AS IT ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO RUN A PROGRAM WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES.

TO DETECT CHANGES INDICATING ABUSE OF SETUID OR SETGID BITS ON FILES, YOU SHOULD MONITOR THE FILE METADATA AND MODIFICATION DATA SOURCE. THIS DATA SOURCE WILL CONTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES TO THE FILE'S PERMISSIONS, OWNERSHIP, AND MODIFICATION TIME. IF YOU SEE CHANGES TO THESE VALUES THAT YOU DO NOT EXPECT, IT MAY INDICATE THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING TO ABUSE THE SETUID OR SETGID BITS.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS RELEVANT TO DETECTING CHANGES INDICATING ABUSE OF SETUID OR SETGID BITS ON FILES. THE REGISTRY IS A DATABASE OF CONFIGURATION SETTINGS FOR THE OPERATING SYSTEM. COMMAND EXECUTION DATA CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMANDS THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED ON THE SYSTEM. NETWORK TRAFFIC DATA CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE NETWORK PACKETS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT AND RECEIVED BY THE SYSTEM."
"Which mitigation technique, designated as M1026 under MITRE ATT&CK, should be implemented to limit permissions for users and user groups in creating tokens?",Configuring System File Integrity,Hardening Kernel Module Loading,Partitioning Network Assets,Privileged Account Management,D,D,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **D**

PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT (PAM) IS A SECURITY FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE AND CONTROL ACCESS TO CRITICAL SYSTEMS AND DATA. PAM CAN BE USED TO LIMIT PERMISSIONS FOR USERS AND USER GROUPS IN CREATING TOKENS, AS WELL AS TO MONITOR AND AUDIT ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS.

CONFIGURING SYSTEM FILE INTEGRITY (A) IS A SECURITY MEASURE THAT HELPS TO ENSURE THAT SYSTEM FILES HAVE NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH. HARDENING KERNEL MODULE LOADING (B) IS A SECURITY MEASURE THAT HELPS TO PROTECT THE KERNEL FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. PARTITIONING NETWORK ASSETS (C) IS A SECURITY MEASURE THAT HELPS TO ISOLATE DIFFERENT PARTS OF A NETWORK FROM EACH OTHER.

WHILE ALL OF THESE MEASURES CAN HELP TO IMPROVE SECURITY, ONLY PAM SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF LIMITING PERMISSIONS FOR USERS AND USER GROUPS IN CREATING TOKENS."
"Considering MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise), which tool is known for its ability to create tokens from known credentials as part of its procedures?",PowerShell Empire,Cobalt Strike,Metasploit Framework,Rubeus,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B) COBALT STRIKE**

COBALT STRIKE IS A PENETRATION TESTING AND RED TEAMING SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWS USERS TO SIMULATE REAL-WORLD ATTACKS AGAINST COMPUTER SYSTEMS. IT IS KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO CREATE TOKENS FROM KNOWN CREDENTIALS AS PART OF ITS PROCEDURES.

POWERSHELL EMPIRE IS A MODULAR POWERSHELL FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE USED FOR BOTH OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE PURPOSES. IT IS NOT KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO CREATE TOKENS FROM KNOWN CREDENTIALS.

METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK IS AN OPEN-SOURCE PENETRATION TESTING FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE USED TO EXPLOIT VULNERABILITIES IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS. IT IS NOT KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO CREATE TOKENS FROM KNOWN CREDENTIALS.

RUBEUS IS A POST-EXPLOITATION FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE USED TO EXECUTE COMMANDS ON REMOTE SYSTEMS. IT IS NOT KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO CREATE TOKENS FROM KNOWN CREDENTIALS."
"According to MITRE ATT&CK, which tool did the Night Dragon adversaries use for cracking password hashes?",Hydra,CrackMapExec,John the Ripper,Cain & Abel,C,D,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **C**.

JOHN THE RIPPER IS A FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE PASSWORD CRACKING SOFTWARE TOOL FOR UNIX, LINUX, AND WINDOWS. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND WIDELY USED PASSWORD CRACKING TOOLS. JOHN THE RIPPER CAN CRACK PASSWORDS STORED IN A VARIETY OF FORMATS, INCLUDING HASHES, PASSWORDS STORED IN FILES, AND PASSWORDS STORED IN WINDOWS SAM FILES.

HYDRA IS A NETWORK LOGIN CRACKER THAT SUPPORTS MANY DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS TO ATTACK, INCLUDING HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, TELNET, SMB, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, AND MORE. HYDRA IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO CRACK PASSWORDS ON A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS.

CAIN & ABEL IS A PASSWORD RECOVERY TOOL FOR WINDOWS. CAIN & ABEL CAN BE USED TO CRACK PASSWORDS STORED IN A VARIETY OF FORMATS, INCLUDING HASHES, PASSWORDS STORED IN FILES, AND PASSWORDS STORED IN WINDOWS SAM FILES. CAIN & ABEL CAN ALSO BE USED TO SNIFF PASSWORDS FROM NETWORK TRAFFIC.

ACCORDING TO MITRE ATT&CK, THE NIGHT DRAGON ADVERSARIES USED JOHN THE RIPPER TO CRACK PASSWORD HASHES."
Which specific data source should be monitored to detect failed authentication attempts that could indicate a brute force attack?,Application Log,User Account Security Log,System Audit Log,User Account Authentication,B,D,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B) USER ACCOUNT SECURITY LOG**

A BRUTE FORCE ATTACK IS AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO A SYSTEM BY TRYING MULTIPLE COMBINATIONS OF USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS. THE USER ACCOUNT SECURITY LOG IS A SPECIFIC DATA SOURCE THAT CAN BE USED TO DETECT FAILED AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS THAT COULD INDICATE A BRUTE FORCE ATTACK. THIS LOG CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT ALL ATTEMPTS TO LOG IN TO A SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE USERNAME, IP ADDRESS, AND TIME OF THE ATTEMPT. IF A USER ATTEMPTS TO LOG IN MULTIPLE TIMES WITH INCORRECT CREDENTIALS, THIS WILL BE LOGGED IN THE USER ACCOUNT SECURITY LOG. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT FAILED AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS. THE APPLICATION LOG CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT ALL APPLICATION ACTIVITY, BUT IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY TRACK FAILED AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS. THE SYSTEM AUDIT LOG CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT ALL SYSTEM ACTIVITY, BUT IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY TRACK FAILED AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS. USER ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION IS A PROCESS, NOT A DATA SOURCE."
What mitigation strategy does MITRE ATT&CK suggest to defend against password cracking by adversaries?,Implementing a strict password expiration policy,Using password managers,Enabling multi-factor authentication,Configuring IP address filtering,C,C,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: C) ENABLING MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION.

MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) IS A SECURITY PROCESS IN WHICH A USER IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TWO OR MORE FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION IN ORDER TO ACCESS A SYSTEM. THIS CAN INCLUDE SOMETHING THE USER KNOWS (SUCH AS A PASSWORD), SOMETHING THE USER HAS (SUCH AS A SECURITY TOKEN), OR SOMETHING THE USER IS (SUCH AS A FINGERPRINT). MFA IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEFEND AGAINST PASSWORD CRACKING ATTACKS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE ATTACKER TO HAVE ACCESS TO BOTH THE USER'S PASSWORD AND ANOTHER FORM OF IDENTIFICATION, WHICH IS OFTEN MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AT DEFENDING AGAINST PASSWORD CRACKING ATTACKS. IMPLEMENTING A STRICT PASSWORD EXPIRATION POLICY CAN HELP TO PREVENT USERS FROM REUSING PASSWORDS ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS, BUT IT DOES NOT PREVENT ATTACKERS FROM USING BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS TO TRY TO GUESS PASSWORDS. USING PASSWORD MANAGERS CAN HELP USERS TO CREATE AND STORE STRONG PASSWORDS, BUT IT DOES NOT PREVENT ATTACKERS FROM ACCESSING THESE PASSWORDS IF THEY ARE STORED ON A COMPROMISED SYSTEM. CONFIGURING IP ADDRESS FILTERING CAN HELP TO PREVENT ATTACKERS FROM ACCESSING SYSTEMS FROM KNOWN MALICIOUS IP ADDRESSES, BUT IT DOES NOT PREVENT ATTACKERS FROM USING PROXIES OR OTHER METHODS TO HIDE THEIR IP ADDRESSES."
How does T1110.001 (Brute Force: Password Guessing) typically try to achieve credential access?,By intercepting network traffic to obtain passwords,By guessing passwords using a repetitive or iterative mechanism,By exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities,By social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing passwords,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: B.

BRUTE FORCE PASSWORD GUESSING IS A METHOD OF TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS TO A SYSTEM BY TRYING A LARGE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE PASSWORDS UNTIL THE CORRECT ONE IS FOUND. THIS CAN BE DONE MANUALLY OR USING A COMPUTER PROGRAM.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE:

* A) INTERCEPTING NETWORK TRAFFIC TO OBTAIN PASSWORDS IS A METHOD OF NETWORK SNIFFING.
* C) EXPLOITING ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES IS A METHOD OF EXPLOITING A VULNERABILITY IN SOFTWARE THAT IS NOT YET KNOWN TO THE VENDOR.
* D) SOCIAL ENGINEERING TACTICS TO TRICK USERS INTO REVEALING PASSWORDS IS A METHOD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING."
APT29 (G0016) used T1110.001 to attack which type of targets?,Internal networking equipment,Operating system vulnerabilities,A list of mailboxes,Web server configuration files,C,C,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: C) A LIST OF MAILBOXES.

T1110.001 IS A TECHNIQUE USED BY THREAT ACTORS TO OBTAIN A LIST OF MAILBOXES FROM A TARGET ORGANIZATION. THIS CAN BE DONE BY EXPLOITING VULNERABILITIES IN EMAIL SERVERS, OR BY USING SOCIAL ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES TO TRICK EMPLOYEES INTO REVEALING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESSES. ONCE A LIST OF MAILBOXES HAS BEEN OBTAINED, THE THREAT ACTOR CAN THEN USE IT TO LAUNCH FURTHER ATTACKS, SUCH AS PHISHING CAMPAIGNS OR CREDENTIAL STUFFING ATTACKS.

INTERNAL NETWORKING EQUIPMENT (A), OPERATING SYSTEM VULNERABILITIES (B), AND WEB SERVER CONFIGURATION FILES (D) ARE ALL POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR CYBER ATTACKS, BUT THEY ARE NOT THE SPECIFIC TARGETS OF T1110.001."
Why are LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts less likely to trigger events compared to SMB?,LDAP and Kerberos have default settings that disable logging,"SMB creates specific ""logon failure"" event ID 4625",LDAP and Kerberos use encryption that prevents logging,SMB sessions expire more quickly than LDAP and Kerberos sessions,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B**.

SMB CREATES SPECIFIC ""LOGON FAILURE"" EVENT ID 4625, WHICH IS LOGGED BY THE WINDOWS SECURITY EVENT LOG. LDAP AND KERBEROS DO NOT CREATE SUCH SPECIFIC EVENT IDS, SO THEIR CONNECTION ATTEMPTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO TRIGGER EVENTS.

A IS INCORRECT BECAUSE LDAP AND KERBEROS DO NOT HAVE DEFAULT SETTINGS THAT DISABLE LOGGING.
C IS INCORRECT BECAUSE LDAP AND KERBEROS DO NOT USE ENCRYPTION THAT PREVENTS LOGGING.
D IS INCORRECT BECAUSE SMB SESSIONS DO NOT EXPIRE MORE QUICKLY THAN LDAP AND KERBEROS SESSIONS."
Which mitigation can help prevent T1110.001 attacks but might cause a denial of service if too strict?,Multi-factor Authentication,Update Software,Account Use Policies,Password Manager Setup,C,C,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **C**

T1110.001 IS A TYPE OF BRUTE FORCE ATTACK THAT USES A DICTIONARY OF COMMON PASSWORDS TO TRY TO GAIN ACCESS TO A SYSTEM. ACCOUNT USE POLICIES CAN HELP PREVENT THIS TYPE OF ATTACK BY REQUIRING USERS TO CHANGE THEIR PASSWORDS REGULARLY AND BY SETTING A MINIMUM PASSWORD LENGTH. HOWEVER, IF THESE POLICIES ARE TOO STRICT, THEY CAN CAUSE A DENIAL OF SERVICE IF USERS ARE UNABLE TO REMEMBER THEIR PASSWORDS OR IF THEY ARE FORCED TO CHANGE THEM TOO OFTEN.

MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) IS A SECURITY PROCESS THAT REQUIRES USERS TO PROVIDE TWO OR MORE FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION IN ORDER TO ACCESS A SYSTEM. THIS CAN HELP PREVENT BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ATTACKERS TO GUESS OR STEAL USERS' PASSWORDS. MFA DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME RISK OF CAUSING A DENIAL OF SERVICE AS ACCOUNT USE POLICIES, BECAUSE USERS ONLY NEED TO PROVIDE THEIR CREDENTIALS ONCE, AFTER WHICH THEY ARE GRANTED ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM.

UPDATING SOFTWARE IS IMPORTANT FOR SECURITY, BUT IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY HELP PREVENT T1110.001 ATTACKS. SOFTWARE UPDATES OFTEN INCLUDE SECURITY PATCHES THAT FIX VULNERABILITIES THAT COULD BE EXPLOITED BY ATTACKERS. HOWEVER, THESE VULNERABILITIES ARE NOT ALWAYS RELATED TO BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS.

PASSWORD MANAGER SETUP IS A GOOD SECURITY PRACTICE, BUT IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY HELP PREVENT T1110.001 ATTACKS. PASSWORD MANAGERS CAN HELP USERS CREATE AND STORE STRONG PASSWORDS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ATTACKERS TO GUESS OR STEAL PASSWORDS. HOWEVER, PASSWORD MANAGERS DO NOT PREVENT BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS FROM OCCURRING."
Which service is commonly targeted by T1110.001 via TCP port 1433?,FTP,Server Message Block (SMB),MySQL,MSSQL,D,D,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: D. MSSQL

T1110.001 IS A MICROSOFT SQL SERVER REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL (RDP) BRUTE FORCE ATTACK. IT IS A COMMON ATTACK VECTOR USED BY CYBERCRIMINALS TO GAIN ACCESS TO MICROSOFT SQL SERVER DATABASES. THE ATTACK INVOLVES TRYING TO GUESS THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD OF A SQL SERVER ACCOUNT BY REPEATEDLY CONNECTING TO THE DATABASE USING DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS. IF THE ATTACKER IS SUCCESSFUL IN GUESSING THE CORRECT USERNAME AND PASSWORD, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE DATABASE AND STEAL SENSITIVE DATA.

THE TCP PORT 1433 IS USED BY MICROSOFT SQL SERVER FOR ITS DEFAULT PORT. THIS MEANS THAT IF A CYBERCRIMINAL IS ABLE TO CONNECT TO A SQL SERVER DATABASE ON PORT 1433, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE T1110.001 TO TRY TO BRUTE FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE DATABASE.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT COMMONLY TARGETED BY T1110.001. FTP IS A FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL THAT IS USED TO TRANSFER FILES BETWEEN COMPUTERS. SMB IS A NETWORK FILE SHARING PROTOCOL THAT IS USED TO SHARE FILES AND FOLDERS OVER A NETWORK. MYSQL IS A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)."
Which tool allows brute-forcing across an entire network as part of T1110.001?,Pony,EMOTET,CrackMapExec,HermeticWizard,C,C,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS C. CRACKMAPEXEC.

CRACKMAPEXEC IS A POST-EXPLOITATION TOOL THAT ALLOWS ATTACKERS TO ENUMERATE AND EXPLOIT SYSTEMS ON A NETWORK. IT CAN BE USED TO BRUTE-FORCE PASSWORDS, EXECUTE COMMANDS, AND MOVE LATERALLY ACROSS A NETWORK.

PONY IS A TROJAN HORSE THAT CAN BE USED TO STEAL DATA AND INSTALL ADDITIONAL MALWARE. EMOTET IS A BANKING TROJAN THAT CAN BE USED TO STEAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION. HERMETICWIZARD IS A DESTRUCTIVE MALWARE THAT CAN BE USED TO WIPE DATA AND DISABLE SYSTEMS.

THEREFORE, THE ONLY TOOL THAT ALLOWS BRUTE-FORCING ACROSS AN ENTIRE NETWORK IS CRACKMAPEXEC."
In which scenario might an adversary combine brute forcing activity with External Remote Services?,Initial Access,Execution,Persistence,Collection,A,A,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: A) INITIAL ACCESS.

BRUTE FORCING IS A METHOD OF TRYING TO GUESS A USERNAME AND PASSWORD COMBINATION IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO A SYSTEM. EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES ARE SERVICES THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S NETWORK. BY COMBINING BRUTE FORCING WITH EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES, AN ADVERSARY CAN TRY TO GUESS THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD COMBINATION FOR AN EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICE IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE ORGANIZATION'S NETWORK.

OPTIONS B, C, AND D ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT DESCRIBE A SCENARIO IN WHICH AN ADVERSARY WOULD COMBINE BRUTE FORCING ACTIVITY WITH EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES."
Which group used a script to attempt RPC authentication during the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack?,APT28,Sandworm Team,Dragonfly,OilRig,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B) SANDWORM TEAM**

Which permission is typically required to execute browser-based pivoting behaviors in the context of T1185?,SeTcbPrivilege,SeShutdownPrivilege,SeDebugPrivilege,SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege,A,C,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **A) SETCBPRIVILEGE**

SETCBPRIVILEGE IS A PRIVILEGE THAT ALLOWS A PROCESS TO EXECUTE CODE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM SECURITY CONTEXT (ALSO KNOWN AS THE LOCALSYSTEM ACCOUNT). THIS PRIVILEGE IS REQUIRED FOR A NUMBER OF TASKS, INCLUDING OPENING FILES AND DEVICES THAT ARE OWNED BY THE SYSTEM, AND ACCESSING SYSTEM-LEVEL APIS.

T1185 IS A TECHNIQUE USED BY THREAT ACTORS TO EXECUTE CODE ON A TARGET SYSTEM BY EXPLOITING VULNERABILITIES IN WEB BROWSERS. THIS TECHNIQUE TYPICALLY INVOLVES TRICKING THE USER INTO VISITING A MALICIOUS WEBSITE THAT CONTAINS CODE THAT IS DESIGNED TO EXPLOIT A VULNERABILITY IN THE BROWSER. ONCE THE VULNERABILITY IS EXPLOITED, THE ATTACKER CAN EXECUTE CODE ON THE TARGET SYSTEM WITH THE PRIVILEGES OF THE USER WHO VISITED THE MALICIOUS WEBSITE.

IN ORDER TO EXECUTE BROWSER-BASED PIVOTING BEHAVIORS IN THE CONTEXT OF T1185, THE ATTACKER MUST HAVE THE SETCBPRIVILEGE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE ATTACKER MUST BE ABLE TO EXECUTE CODE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM SECURITY CONTEXT IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM-LEVEL APIS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE BROWSER-BASED PIVOTING BEHAVIORS.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT PROVIDE THE ATTACKER WITH THE PRIVILEGES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE BROWSER-BASED PIVOTING BEHAVIORS IN THE CONTEXT OF T1185.

OPTION B, T1562: IMPAIR DEFENSES, REFERS TO ADVERSARIES DISABLING OR MODIFYING SECURITY CONTROLS. OPTION D, T1547: BOOT OR LOGON AUTOSTART EXECUTION, REFERS TO ADVERSARIES EXECUTING MALICIOUS CODE AT BOOT OR LOGON."
"In the context of MITRE ATT&CK, which mitigation strategy is recommended to prevent adversaries from utilizing unused cloud regions for Defense Evasion?",Deactivate unused regions in the cloud provider.,Enable all advanced detection services across all regions.,Increase the number of regions under surveillance.,Limit account access to cloud management systems.,A,A,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: A) DEACTIVATE UNUSED REGIONS IN THE CLOUD PROVIDER.

THE MITRE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK IS A KNOWLEDGE BASE OF ADVERSARY TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES THAT ARE USED IN CYBER ATTACKS. THE FRAMEWORK IS USED BY SECURITY PROFESSIONALS TO UNDERSTAND AND DEFEND AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS.

THE DEFENSE EVASION TACTIC IS USED BY ADVERSARIES TO HIDE THEIR ACTIVITIES FROM DETECTION. ONE WAY THAT ADVERSARIES CAN USE DEFENSE EVASION IS TO UTILIZE UNUSED CLOUD REGIONS. UNUSED CLOUD REGIONS CAN BE USED TO STORE MALICIOUS FILES, LAUNCH ATTACKS, AND EVADE DETECTION.

TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF ADVERSARIES UTILIZING UNUSED CLOUD REGIONS FOR DEFENSE EVASION, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO DEACTIVATE UNUSED REGIONS IN THE CLOUD PROVIDER. THIS WILL PREVENT ADVERSARIES FROM USING THESE REGIONS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE RISK OF ADVERSARIES UTILIZING UNUSED CLOUD REGIONS FOR DEFENSE EVASION. OPTION B, ENABLE ALL ADVANCED DETECTION SERVICES ACROSS ALL REGIONS, MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING MALICIOUS ACTIVITY IN UNUSED CLOUD REGIONS, BUT IT DOES NOT PREVENT ADVERSARIES FROM USING THESE REGIONS. OPTION C, INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REGIONS UNDER SURVEILLANCE, MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DETECTING MALICIOUS ACTIVITY IN UNUSED CLOUD REGIONS, BUT IT DOES NOT PREVENT ADVERSARIES FROM USING THESE REGIONS. OPTION D, LIMIT ACCOUNT ACCESS TO CLOUD MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, MAY PREVENT ADVERSARIES FROM ACCESSING UNUSED CLOUD REGIONS, BUT IT DOES NOT PREVENT THEM FROM USING OTHER CLOUD REGIONS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES.

THEREFORE, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: A) DEACTIVATE UNUSED REGIONS IN THE CLOUD PROVIDER."
Which tactic does MITRE ATT&CK technique T1550.001 pertain to?,Initial Access,Persistence,Defense Evasion,,A,C,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: A) INITIAL ACCESS

MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUE T1550.001 IS ""CREATE OR USE ACCOUNT."" THIS TECHNIQUE IS USED BY ATTACKERS TO CREATE OR USE AN ACCOUNT ON A TARGET SYSTEM IN ORDER TO GAIN INITIAL ACCESS.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE:

* OPTION B, ""PERSISTENCE,"" IS USED BY ATTACKERS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO A TARGET SYSTEM AFTER THEY HAVE GAINED INITIAL ACCESS.
* OPTION C, ""DEFENSE EVASION,"" IS USED BY ATTACKERS TO EVADE DETECTION AND ANALYSIS BY SECURITY TOOLS.
* OPTION D, ""NAN,"" IS NOT A VALID OPTION."
What is the primary purpose of application access tokens as described in T1550.001?,To directly store user credentials,To make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service,To serve as alternative passwords for user accounts,To encrypt sensitive user data,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: B.

APPLICATION ACCESS TOKENS ARE USED TO MAKE AUTHORIZED API REQUESTS ON BEHALF OF A USER OR SERVICE. THEY ARE NOT USED TO DIRECTLY STORE USER CREDENTIALS, SERVE AS ALTERNATIVE PASSWORDS FOR USER ACCOUNTS, OR ENCRYPT SENSITIVE USER DATA."
Which OAuth-related action can an adversary perform using a compromised access token in cloud-based email services?,Generate new access tokens,Encrypt communications,Perform REST API functions such as email searching and contact enumeration,Disable two-factor authentication,C,C,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS C.

OAUTH IS AN OPEN STANDARD FOR AUTHORIZATION THAT ENABLES THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS TO ACCESS USER DATA ON A WEB SERVER WITHOUT THE USER HAVING TO PROVIDE THEIR USERNAME AND PASSWORD. A COMPROMISED ACCESS TOKEN CAN BE USED BY AN ADVERSARY TO PERFORM REST API FUNCTIONS SUCH AS EMAIL SEARCHING AND CONTACT ENUMERATION.

GENERATING NEW ACCESS TOKENS IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH A COMPROMISED ACCESS TOKEN. ENCRYPTING COMMUNICATIONS REQUIRES THE USE OF A KEY, WHICH IS NOT TYPICALLY STORED IN AN ACCESS TOKEN. DISABLING TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION REQUIRES THE USER'S PASSWORD, WHICH IS NOT TYPICALLY STORED IN AN ACCESS TOKEN."
"During the SolarWinds Compromise (C0024), what specific method did APT29 use to make changes to the Office 365 environment?",Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities,Crafting spear-phishing emails,Using compromised service principals,Intercepting network traffic,C,C,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: C.

APT29 USED COMPROMISED SERVICE PRINCIPALS TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE OFFICE 365 ENVIRONMENT. SERVICE PRINCIPALS ARE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE USED BY APPLICATIONS TO ACCESS RESOURCES ON A NETWORK. APT29 COMPROMISED THESE ACCOUNTS BY STEALING THEIR PASSWORDS OR BY USING PHISHING ATTACKS TO TRICK USERS INTO GIVING UP THEIR CREDENTIALS. ONCE THEY HAD ACCESS TO THESE ACCOUNTS, APT29 WAS ABLE TO USE THEM TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE OFFICE 365 ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS ADDING NEW USERS OR GROUPS, OR CHANGING PERMISSIONS.

EXPLOITING ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES IS A METHOD THAT ATTACKERS USE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SECURITY VULNERABILITIES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PATCHED. THIS CAN BE A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO GAIN ACCESS TO A SYSTEM, BUT IT IS ALSO A VERY RISKY METHOD, AS IT CAN BE DETECTED BY SECURITY SYSTEMS.

CRAFTING SPEAR-PHISHING EMAILS IS A METHOD THAT ATTACKERS USE TO TRICK USERS INTO CLICKING ON MALICIOUS LINKS OR OPENING MALICIOUS ATTACHMENTS. THIS CAN BE A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO INFECT A SYSTEM WITH MALWARE, BUT IT IS ALSO A RELATIVELY LOW-RISK METHOD, AS IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE ATTACKER TO HAVE ANY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM THEY ARE TARGETING.

INTERCEPTING NETWORK TRAFFIC IS A METHOD THAT ATTACKERS USE TO EAVESDROP ON COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN TWO SYSTEMS. THIS CAN BE A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT A SYSTEM, BUT IT IS ALSO A VERY DIFFICULT METHOD TO EXECUTE, AS IT REQUIRES THE ATTACKER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE NETWORK BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS."
Which mitigation strategy advises the use of token binding to cryptographically secure an application access token?,Application Developer Guidance (M1013),Encrypt Sensitive Information (M1041),Restrict Web-Based Content (M1021),Audit (M1047),B,A,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B**

TOKEN BINDING IS A SECURITY MECHANISM THAT LINKS A SECURITY TOKEN TO A SPECIFIC USER OR ENTITY. THIS HELPS TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO RESOURCES, AS THE TOKEN CANNOT BE USED WITHOUT THE CORRESPONDING USER OR ENTITY.

ENCRYPTING SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS A SECURITY MECHANISM THAT PROTECTS DATA FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS BY SCRAMBLING IT USING A MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHM. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR UNAUTHORIZED USERS TO READ THE DATA, EVEN IF THEY ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN IT.

RESTRICTING WEB-BASED CONTENT IS A SECURITY MECHANISM THAT LIMITS THE TYPES OF CONTENT THAT CAN BE ACCESSED ON A WEB SERVER. THIS HELPS TO PREVENT USERS FROM ACCESSING MALICIOUS CONTENT, SUCH AS MALWARE OR PHISHING WEBSITES.

AUDITING IS A SECURITY MECHANISM THAT TRACKS AND RECORDS USER ACTIVITY. THIS HELPS TO IDENTIFY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND TO INVESTIGATE SECURITY INCIDENTS.

OF THE FOUR OPTIONS, ONLY TOKEN BINDING SPECIFICALLY ADVISES THE USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY TO PROTECT AN APPLICATION ACCESS TOKEN. THEREFORE, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS **B**."
"According to Detection insights for T1550.001, what activity should be monitored to detect misuse of application access tokens?",File transfer logs,Network traffic patterns,Web Credential Usage,User login attempts,B,C,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B) NETWORK TRAFFIC PATTERNS**

ACCORDING TO DETECTION INSIGHTS FOR T1550.001, MISUSE OF APPLICATION ACCESS TOKENS CAN BE DETECTED BY MONITORING NETWORK TRAFFIC PATTERNS FOR UNUSUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS A SUDDEN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS FROM A SINGLE IP ADDRESS OR A CHANGE IN THE DESTINATION OF REQUESTS.

FILE TRANSFER LOGS, WEB CREDENTIAL USAGE, AND USER LOGIN ATTEMPTS ARE NOT SPECIFIC INDICATORS OF MISUSE OF APPLICATION ACCESS TOKENS."
What is the purpose of the Pass the Hash technique (T1550.002) in cyber threat intelligence?,To encrypt the authentication channel used in communications,To authenticate as a user without having access to their cleartext password,To intercept and manipulate network traffic,To encrypt stored password hashes,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: B.

PASS THE HASH IS A TECHNIQUE USED BY ATTACKERS TO AUTHENTICATE AS A USER ON A SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING ACCESS TO THEIR CLEARTEXT PASSWORD. THIS IS DONE BY STEALING THE HASH OF THE USER'S PASSWORD FROM THE SYSTEM AND THEN USING THAT HASH TO AUTHENTICATE TO THE SYSTEM.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT. OPTION A IS INCORRECT BECAUSE PASS THE HASH DOES NOT ENCRYPT THE AUTHENTICATION CHANNEL USED IN COMMUNICATIONS. OPTION C IS INCORRECT BECAUSE PASS THE HASH DOES NOT INTERCEPT AND MANIPULATE NETWORK TRAFFIC. OPTION D IS INCORRECT BECAUSE PASS THE HASH DOES NOT ENCRYPT STORED PASSWORD HASHES."
Which of the following groups has used tools such as Mimikatz for lateral movement via captured password hashes according to MITRE ATT&CK?,APT29,APT41,APT33,APT32,A,B,False,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **A) APT29**

APT29 IS A CYBER ESPIONAGE GROUP THAT HAS BEEN ACTIVE SINCE AT LEAST 2010. THE GROUP IS BELIEVED TO BE SPONSORED BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND IS KNOWN FOR ITS SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS AGAINST HIGH-VALUE TARGETS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, THINK TANKS, AND CORPORATIONS.

APT29 HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE USE OF A NUMBER OF TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MIMIKATZ, A PASSWORD-STEALING TOOL. MIMIKATZ CAN BE USED TO EXTRACT PASSWORD HASHES FROM MEMORY, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED TO IMPERSONATE USERS AND GAIN ACCESS TO SYSTEMS.

APT29 HAS ALSO BEEN KNOWN TO USE LATERAL MOVEMENT TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS EXPLOITING VULNERABILITIES IN REMOTE DESKTOP SERVICES (RDS) TO MOVE FROM ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER. LATERAL MOVEMENT ALLOWS ATTACKERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO MORE SYSTEMS AND DATA, AND CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK AND STOP THEIR ATTACKS.

THE USE OF MIMIKATZ AND LATERAL MOVEMENT TECHNIQUES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES (TTPS) OF APT29. THEREFORE, THE MOST LIKELY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS THAT APT29 HAS USED TOOLS SUCH AS MIMIKATZ FOR LATERAL MOVEMENT VIA CAPTURED PASSWORD HASHES ACCORDING TO MITRE ATT&CK."
How does 'Overpass the Hash' differ from 'Pass the Hash'?,It introduces encryption to communications,It uses the password hash to create a Kerberos ticket,It only works on Linux systems,It requires re-authentication every session,B,B,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **B**.

OVERPASS THE HASH IS A TECHNIQUE THAT USES THE PASSWORD HASH TO CREATE A KERBEROS TICKET. THIS TICKET CAN THEN BE USED TO AUTHENTICATE TO A REMOTE SYSTEM WITHOUT THE NEED TO ENTER THE PASSWORD AGAIN. PASS THE HASH, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A TECHNIQUE THAT SIMPLY PASSES THE PASSWORD HASH TO THE REMOTE SYSTEM. THIS MEANS THAT THE PASSWORD HASH IS STORED ON THE REMOTE SYSTEM, WHICH COULD BE A SECURITY RISK.

HERE IS A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION OF EACH OPTION:

* OPTION A: IT INTRODUCES ENCRYPTION TO COMMUNICATIONS. THIS IS NOT A CORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE OVERPASS THE HASH DOES NOT INTRODUCE ENCRYPTION TO COMMUNICATIONS.
* OPTION B: IT USES THE PASSWORD HASH TO CREATE A KERBEROS TICKET. THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE OVERPASS THE HASH USES THE PASSWORD HASH TO CREATE A KERBEROS TICKET.
* OPTION C: IT ONLY WORKS ON LINUX SYSTEMS. THIS IS NOT A CORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE OVERPASS THE HASH CAN BE USED ON BOTH LINUX AND WINDOWS SYSTEMS.
* OPTION D: IT REQUIRES RE-AUTHENTICATION EVERY SESSION. THIS IS NOT A CORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE OVERPASS THE HASH DOES NOT REQUIRE RE-AUTHENTICATION EVERY SESSION."

PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT (PAM) IS A SECURITY PRACTICE THAT HELPS ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE AND PROTECT THEIR PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS. PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS ARE ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE ELEVATED PERMISSIONS AND CAN BE USED TO PERFORM SENSITIVE TASKS. PAM CAN HELP ORGANIZATIONS TO:

* IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
* IMPLEMENT STRONG PASSWORD POLICIES FOR PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
* MONITOR AND AUDIT PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT ACTIVITY
* RESTRICT ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
* ROTATE PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS

RESETTING THE KRBTGT ACCOUNT PASSWORD TWICE TO INVALIDATE EXISTING GOLDEN TICKETS IS A PAM BEST PRACTICE. THIS HELPS TO ENSURE THAT EVEN IF AN ATTACKER IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THE KRBTGT ACCOUNT PASSWORD, THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE IT TO CREATE GOLDEN TICKETS THAT WILL BE VALID FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AT MITIGATING THE RISK OF GOLDEN TICKET ATTACKS. PASSWORD POLICIES CAN HELP TO PROTECT PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS, BUT THEY ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS PAM AT PREVENTING THE CREATION OF GOLDEN TICKETS. USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT CAN HELP TO PROTECT USER ACCOUNTS, BUT IT IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS PAM AT PROTECTING PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS. ACTIVE DIRECTORY CONFIGURATION CAN HELP TO SECURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY, BUT IT IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS PAM AT PREVENTING THE CREATION OF GOLDEN TICKETS."

"Given the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1550.004, which mitigation strategy can be employed to reduce the risk of session cookie misuse?",Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA),Regularly updating user credentials,Monitoring application logs for unusual activities,Configuring browsers to regularly delete persistent cookies,D,D,True,"THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: **D**

SESSION COOKIES ARE USED TO STORE INFORMATION ABOUT A USER'S SESSION ON A WEBSITE, SUCH AS THEIR LOGIN STATUS, THE PAGES THEY HAVE VISITED, AND THE ITEMS THEY HAVE ADDED TO THEIR SHOPPING CART. SESSION COOKIES ARE TYPICALLY DELETED WHEN THE USER CLOSES THEIR BROWSER. HOWEVER, PERSISTENT COOKIES CAN REMAIN ON THE USER'S COMPUTER FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, EVEN AFTER THE USER HAS CLOSED THEIR BROWSER. THIS CAN ALLOW ATTACKERS TO STEAL SESSION COOKIES AND USE THEM TO IMPERSONATE THE USER ON THE WEBSITE.

ONE WAY TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF SESSION COOKIE MISUSE IS TO CONFIGURE BROWSERS TO REGULARLY DELETE PERSISTENT COOKIES. THIS WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT SESSION COOKIES ARE NOT STORED ON THE USER'S COMPUTER FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND THAT THEY ARE DELETED IF THE USER'S BROWSER IS COMPROMISED.

THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AT MITIGATING THE RISK OF SESSION COOKIE MISUSE. IMPLEMENTING MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) CAN HELP TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ACCOUNTS, BUT IT WILL NOT PREVENT ATTACKERS FROM STEALING SESSION COOKIES. REGULARLY UPDATING USER CREDENTIALS CAN HELP TO PROTECT AGAINST ACCOUNT TAKEOVER ATTACKS, BUT IT WILL NOT PREVENT ATTACKERS FROM USING STOLEN SESSION COOKIES TO ACCESS ACCOUNTS. MONITORING APPLICATION LOGS FOR UNUSUAL ACTIVITIES CAN HELP TO DETECT ATTACKS THAT ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY, BUT IT WILL NOT PREVENT ATTACKERS FROM STEALING SESSION COOKIES IN THE FIRST PLACE.

THEREFORE, THE BEST OPTION TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF SESSION COOKIE MISUSE IS TO CONFIGURE BROWSERS TO REGULARLY DELETE PERSISTENT COOKIES."
