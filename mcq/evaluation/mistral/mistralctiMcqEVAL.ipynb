This is because sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers file. However, the setuid and setgid bits are used to allow a user to run a program with the privileges of another user (usually the owner of the set-user-ID or set-group-ID program), without needing to know the password of that user. Therefore, any changes to these bits can indicate an attempt to escalate privileges. The other options are not relevant to Linux or sudo.\n",

            "Answer: A\n",
            "Explanation: T1110.001 is a technique related to brute force attacks, where an attacker tries multiple passwords to gain unauthorized access. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can help prevent these attacks by requiring additional verification factors beyond just a password. However, if MFA is too strict (e.g., requiring multiple factors for every login attempt), it might cause a denial of service for legitimate users who are unable to meet the strict requirements. On the other hand, updating software, account use policies, and password manager setup do not directly address brute force attacks.\n",
