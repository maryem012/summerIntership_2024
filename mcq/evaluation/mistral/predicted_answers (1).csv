Option A: Setting up a firewall
Option B: Using a browser extension allow or deny list
Option C: Auditing the installed extensions
Option D: Updating antivirus definitions
Answer: B
Explanation: Using a browser extension allow or deny list can help prevent the installation of unauthorized browser extensions by allowing only specific extensions to be installed or denying the installation of all extensions. This can be implemented using a browser extension management tool, such as Google Chrome's ""Extensions"" page, where you can enable or disable extensions. Setting up a firewall can help prevent unauthorized access to a network, but it is not specific to preventing the installation of browser extensions. Auditing the installed extensions can help identify any unauthorized extensions that have already been installed, but it cannot prevent the installation of new unauthorized extensions. Updating antivirus definitions can help protect against new malware, but it is not specific to preventing the installation of unauthorized browser extensions.
