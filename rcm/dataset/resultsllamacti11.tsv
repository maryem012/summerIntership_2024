For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see XSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode.  Since Xen itself needs to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run directly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests this means running on the shadow of the guest root page table.  In the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool associated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.  This tearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in question is presently running on.

This tearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in question is presently running on.  While a precaution exists to supposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table, the time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary  When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program. However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map directly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one (which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a RCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes, the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur use-after-free problem.  Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to reduce the size of bpf_map.	"Analyze the following CVE description and determine the appropriate CWE.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not supported  If SetVariable at runtime is not supported by the firmware we never assign a callback for that function. At the same time mount the efivarfs as RO so no one can call that.  However, we never check the permission flags when someone remounts the filesystem as RW. As a result this leads to a crash looking like this:  $ mount -o remount,rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars $ efi-updatevar -f PK.auth PK  [  303.279166] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000 [  303.280482] Mem abort info: [  303.280854]   ESR = 0x0000000086000004 [  303.281338]   EC = 0x21: IABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [  303.282016]   SET = 0, FnV = 0 [  303.282414]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [  303.282821]   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault [  303.283771] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=000000004258c000 [  303.284913] [0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 [  303.286076] Internal error: Oops: 0000000086000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP [  303.286936] Modules linked in: qrtr tpm_tis tpm_tis_core crct10dif_ce arm_smccc_trng rng_core drm fuse ip_tables x_tables ipv6 [  303.288586] CPU: 1 PID: 755 Comm: efi-updatevar Not tainted 6.3.0-rc1-00108-gc7d0c4695c68 #1 [  303.289748] Hardware name: Unknown Unknown Product/Unknown Product, BIOS 2023.04-00627-g88336918701d 04/01/2023 [  303.291150] pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) [  303.292123] pc : 0x0 [  303.292443] lr : efivar_set_variable_locked+0x74/0xec [  303.293156] sp : ffff800008673c10 [  303.293619] x29: ffff800008673c10 x28: ffff0000037e8000 x27: 0000000000000000 [  303.294592] x26: 0000000000000800 x25: ffff000002467400 x24: 0000000000000027 [  303.295572] x23: ffffd49ea9832000 x22: ffff0000020c9800 x21: ffff000002467000 [  303.296566] x20: 0000000000000001 x19: 00000000000007fc x18: 0000000000000000 [  303.297531] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 0000aaaac807ab54 [  303.298495] x14: ed37489f673633c0 x13: 71c45c606de13f80 x12: 47464259e219acf4 [  303.299453] x11: ffff000002af7b01 x10: 0000000000000003 x9 : 0000000000000002 [  303.300431] x8 : 0000000000000010 x7 : ffffd49ea8973230 x6 : 0000000000a85201 [  303.301412] x5 : 0000000000000000 x4 : ffff0000020c9800 x3 : 00000000000007fc [  303.302370] x2 : 0000000000000027 x1 : ffff000002467400 x0 : ffff000002467000 [  303.303341] Call trace: [  303.303679]  0x0 [  303.303938]  efivar_entry_set_get_size+0x98/0x16c [  303.304585]  efivarfs_file_write+0xd0/0x1a4 [  303.305148]  vfs_write+0xc4/0x2e4 [  303.305601]  ksys_write+0x70/0x104 [  303.306073]  __arm64_sys_write+0x1c/0x28 [  303.306622]  invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114 [  303.307156]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x44/0xec [  303.307803]  do_el0_svc+0x38/0x98 [  303.308268]  el0_svc+0x2c/0x84 [  303.308702]  el0t_64_sync_handler+0xf4/0x120 [  303.309293]  el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 [  303.309794] Code: ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...  Call trace:    drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]    drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]    drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]    dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]    msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]  The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

When CubeCS creates new users, it leaks the users secret key. This could allow a lower-privileged user with access to the logs to retrieve sensitive information and impersonate other users with higher privileges than themselves. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than upgrading CubeFS.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: fix race between async notify and socket close  The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data.  Try to avoid the locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend solely on the atomic ref counter for synchronization.  Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we are now tightly controlling when completion fires.	"Analyze the following CVE description and determine the appropriate CWE.
